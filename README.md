# Joke_Project_Based_ESP32_HTTP_JOKEAPI
This ESP32 project connects to Wi-Fi, fetches programming jokes from an online API, and displays them on an Adafruit ILI9341 TFT display. Using the Wi-Fi and HTTPClient libraries, it retrieves JSON data, parses it with ArduinoJson, and handles both single-line and two-part jokes. Pressing a button fetches a new joke, making it interactive and fun.
